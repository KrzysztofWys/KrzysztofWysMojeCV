			<section>
				<p>I am an electronic engineer. I am oriented on problem solving and problem avoiding by nature. I want to enter the IT to develop in machine learning and cloud technologies as a programmer.  I have a thorough knowledge of PC (with DOS and CP/M). For me English is both a  working & learning language.</p>
				
				<p>I have good experience in technical support of commercial IoT services and IoT service administration in a worldwide company, delivering solutions IoT for smart homes and buildings. The platform includes gateways, a cloud architecture, APIs, mobile applications and e-maintenace tool.
				
				I also have experience in programming production equipment and and HVAC automation in commercial buildings. </p>
				
				<p>On the other side, I completed additional humanistic  post-gradiuation studies - programm for trainers &  coaches a few years ago, as I believe that a good engineer should develop also soft skills.
