			<p>My life is going on with electronic development. I have been working with computers for years, as I
				started with devices such as ZX Spectrum with the CP/M, afterwards dBase system and HTML text editors.
				Today, I am still impressed by the continuous development of computer technology and its presence
				everywhere. And I want to use my knowledge and skills in this area, finally in developing machine
				learning applications. To this, I get to know (still) the Python programming language. I also feel
				comfortable in web design and in object-oriented programming.</p>
			<p>Over the last 9 years I have been involved in the commercial development of platform for home automation
				in an international company. That platform includes gateways, cloud architecture, APIs, mobile and
				utility applications. I managed the platform administration on the Polish market. At the same time, I
				dealt with programming of devices for automation control in commercial buildings. All the knowledge in
				this field I gained in English.</p>

				Strongests Points!</button>

			<div id="MyStrengths">
				<p>My strong points are:<br>
					– wide knowledge of programming<br>
					– very good practical understanding of English<br>
					– mathematical and analitical skills<br>
					– information search skills<br>
					– first experience with cloud architecture.</p>
				<p>On the other side, I completed additional humanistic post-gradiuation studies - programm for trainers
					&
					coaches a few years ago, as I believe that a good engineer should develop also soft skills.
